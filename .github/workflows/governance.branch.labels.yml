            **Pro Tip!**
            You can help us label your Pull Requests by using the following branch naming convention next time you create a pull request.
            Branch naming convention | Label
            ------------------------ | ------
            `feature/**`             | kind/feature
            `fix/**`                  | kind/fix
            `chore/**`               | kind/chore
            `stable/**`              | kind/stable
            `docs/**`                | kind/docs
            <hr>
            If your changes do not fall into any of these categories, don't worry.
            You can just ignore this message in that case! ðŸ‘€
