  Hi there @{issue-author} :wave:!
  I closed this issue because it was labelled as a support question.
  Please help us organize discussion by posting this on the http://discourse.jupyter.org/ forum.
  Our goal is to sustain a positive experience for both users and developers. We use GitHub issues for specific discussions related to changing a repository's content, and let the forum be where we can more generally help and inspire each other.

  Thanks you for being an active member of our community! :heart:
